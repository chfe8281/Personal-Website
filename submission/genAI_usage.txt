PROJECTS       
Odyssey Game                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      I developed  a two-player board-game using C++. I customized the game by adding a new tile that generated a random anagram for the player to solve.. I implemented two classes and two structs.

File System Simulation                                               
A partner and I developed  a Linux file system simulation in C++. We stored files and directories in an n-ary tree data structure and a hash table, as well as built functions for Linux commands. We collaborated on this project with GitHub and git version control.

I assisted students in recitations and collaborated with TAs and other faculty during weekly SIGMI meetings.
